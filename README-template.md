# How to Document READMEs for Open Source Projects at Wizeline

This document provides recommendations for documenting a README file for open source projects at Wizeline. It outlines two paths to follow. The first one suggests you to do a checklist of things you need to consider before writing your README. Once you have identified the main points to address, you can follow the second pathway and start writing down your README using a sample template. Feel free to choose the pathway that best suits your needs. Let's get started!

- **Pathway 1 - README Checklist** \
Refer to the [README Checklist](https://github.com/ddbeck/readme-checklist/blob/main/checklist.md) from Daniel D. Beck to start outlining your README file. 

- **Pathway 2 - README Template** \
Use the following template as a guide to include the information you gathered from your checklist. Bear in mind that you can personalize it, so feel free to skip sections.
